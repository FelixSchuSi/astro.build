The Astro ecosystem continues to grow! [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) -- a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Javascript and related technologies by [JetBrains](https://twitter.com/JetBrains) -- has just announced initial support for Astro. 

Webstorm users will get an improved development experience for Astro projects with syntax highlighting, code completion, automatic imports, refactorings, navigation, intentions, code folding, Emmet support, and auto formatting.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">yessss, please, inject astro support into my veins</p>&mdash; pyotr (@saintpyotr) <a href="https://twitter.com/saintpyotr/status/1621529196815331328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To get started, [download the Astro plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20959-astro?_gl=1*petsct*_ga*MTA1NTkwNTk0Ni4xNjc1NDQzMjM0*_ga_9J976DJZ68*MTY3NTQ0MzIzNC4xLjEuMTY3NTQ0NDcwNC4wLjAuMA..&_ga=2.206005648.2026736914.1675443234-1055905946.1675443234) from JetBrains Marketplace. You can also install it directly from inside your Webstorm IDE by going to Preferences / Settings and searching for ‚ÄúAstro‚Äù in Plugins.

Webstorm is planning to add [even more advanced features](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2023/02/webstorm-2023-1-eap-3/) for Astro going forward. Needless to say, we‚Äôre already excited for that! In the meantime, we hope Webstorm users enjoy using Astro. Let us know how it goes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild) üöÄ
